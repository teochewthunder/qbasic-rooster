# QBasic Rooster
A very *very* basic rendering of a dancing rooster. (geddit? hur hur)

## Tune
A trial and error job. The redrawing of the rooster is tied to the changes in music, and it looks like the rooster is dancing to the tune.

## Redrawing
Torso remains large unchanged, though head and legs will move. Thus they are rendered using different functions.
